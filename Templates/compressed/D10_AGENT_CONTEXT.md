# D10: Agent Context — {name}
Meta: pkg:{id} | updated:{date}

## What This Project Does
One paragraph, end-to-end, plain language. Builder reads this first.

## Architecture Overview
ASCII command flow diagram + directory structure with descriptions.

## Key Patterns (4-6)
Per pattern: name + one sentence + D1/D5 reference.

## Commands
Copy-pasteable bash: build, test, run single test, full regression.

## Tool Rules
| USE THIS | NOT THIS | WHY |

## Coding Conventions
Language version, stdlib policy, type hints, dataclasses, error handling, exit codes, test framework.

## Submission Protocol
Ordered steps: 13Q → STOP → build via DTT → RESULTS file with hashes → full regression.
Branch naming, commit format, results file path.

## Active Components
| Component | Where | Interface (signature) |

## Links to Deeper Docs
D1-D9: one line each, what to find there. Note D9 is kept separate from builders during active build.
