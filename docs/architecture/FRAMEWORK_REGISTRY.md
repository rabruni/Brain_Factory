# Framework Registry

**Status**: Consolidated into BUILD-PLAN.md

The framework registry (segregation, build order, coding boundaries, dependency graph) is maintained in:

- **`architecture/BUILD-PLAN.md`** — Section "KERNEL Framework Inventory" for framework table, dependency graph, install order, and build timeline
- **`architecture/FWK-0-DRAFT.md`** — Section 3.0 for the Framework Decomposition Standard (splitting, merging, ownership tests)

This file exists to resolve references in NORTH_STAR.md, BUILDER_SPEC.md, and OPERATIONAL_SPEC.md which point to `FRAMEWORK_REGISTRY.md`.
